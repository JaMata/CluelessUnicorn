# Hello. :shipit:

**Clueless Unicorns** is a simplified version of the popular board game Clue. The requirements of the application were set forth by the professors of Foundations of Software Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. In fact, this online-murder-mystery board game is the final project of the aforementioned course! We've moved through distinct software development lifecycle phases, providing deliverables all along the way.
